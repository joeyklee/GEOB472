# Pirates code in R:

### About
This is just a quick R primer. 

### Focus Things:
+ Print everything - check that things are working and see how you change and manipulate data with functions and operations.
+ Plot everything - again, check that things are working and see how you change and manipulate data with functions and operations.
+ Help you classmates and friends - these will be the people you work with in the future - this is your network! The stronger you guys are and closer you are, the better connections you'll have. 
+ (on the above point) the success of this class will be judged on your progression. 

### Outline

#### Getting Comfy:
1. R ( and computer languages in general) are like more awesome calculators:
	+ basic math operations between single numbers
	+ enter: Print & Plot
	+ introducing vectors
	+ introducing matrices
	+ basic math with vectors / matrices
	+ cool contour/heatmap with matrix
2. Dataframes are your best friend:
	+ understanding dataframes - what are they and why are they awesome?
	+ getting comfy with data frames - let's make one!
	+ let's plot some columns! 
	+ getting more comfy with dataframes - let's load one!
	+ Let's plot those columns! 
	+ basic math operations with dataframes - pretty much the same as with vectors! 
	
3. R packages:
	+ what are they? why are they super awesome? why do they make our lives better in so many ways?
	+ installing
	+ searching for them: web search time! 

4. Control structures / Loops

#### The good stuff (map time!)

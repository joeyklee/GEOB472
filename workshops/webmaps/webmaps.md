# Hello Web Maps

### About

The web has several advantages when it comes to data visualization: 1. The ability to reach a wide audience and 2. Interactivity. Web maps are thus a powerful way of communicating your work and allowing people to interact with the information you publish. The web also creates the need for accountability and peer to peer review. 

### What we'll cover

1. How does the internet work --> client and server
2. Web map fundamentals
3. How to make your first interactive web maps with Mapbox Studio
4. How you can take it further (with leaflet.js/mapbox.js, etc)


### What you'll need

+ [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/)
+ Text editor

# Shapes & Code: Recipes for building visuals (an introduction to Processing)
### About
<!--
While there are a myriad of tools that exist that enable us to turn our ideas into tangible, visual output, the fundamental building block of all these software is code. 

In an increadingly software driven world, it is important (some might say our social responsibility) to have a basic understanding of how software  works 
-->

In this workshop we will be introduced to [Processing](https://processing.org) - a programming language and environment developed "to promote literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology". Processing is used across a variety of communities but has had particular success within the art and design community (and data visualization community) for its strength in generating visual and interactive output. We will will use Processing to:

1. Become familiar with the fundamental concepts of programming visual outputs with code.
2. Build our confidence in using code as a material/tool to turn our ideas into something tangible.
3. Learn about the process of deconstructing tasks into modular steps (don't worry if this doesn't mean anything to you yet!).
4. Explore the ways in which code can create accountability for the visualization process. 

### What You'll Need
+ Download [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) for your specific operating system. 
+ The confidence, curiosity and enthusiasm to learn and the drive to teach yourself and the patience to help those around you.

### Workshop Topics Covered:
1. Introduction to form and code and visualizations
2. Introduciton to Processing, the environment, and the Community
3. Basic programming fundamentals in Processing
4. How to google search and read documentation

### Assignment (to be started in class)
+ Draw the PROUN by El Lissitzky in Processing:
	+ Add 3 unique features to your image - play with  fill colors, stroke, shape size, etc.

from ucla DMA project 1: http://classes.dma.ucla.edu/Spring15/28/projects.html
Build on the ideas from Workshop 1 to write a Processing sketch that draws this El Lissitzky PROUN. Add at least five variables that change the composition in a thoughtful way. Focus on the complexity of the changes and relationships in the composition. As with Workshop 1, the goal of Project 1 is to think about an image as a system. (Remember the Alexander Calder mobile example.) One program, one set of relations, is a generator for many related compositions.

Arrive to class on Wednesday with a variety of professional drawings on paper or on screen that show how you plan to add variables to the PROUN to modify the composition. We will spend the time in class starting to realize the sketches in code. The final program must be 1000 x 1000 pixels.

Include the range for each variable as a comment on the same line of code where you create the variable (e.g. float d = 10; // Define 'd' between 5 and 30). We will show you how to upload code to the server at the beginning of class on the due date

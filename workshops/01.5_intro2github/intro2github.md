# Documenting, sharing, and developing collaborative projects: An introduction to versioning control and social coding with Github

### About
Cartography and Data visualization are about the process of mapping information, not just the chart and map at the end. As people involved in data visualizaiton, we have an important responsibility to make sure our work is transparent, replicable, and accurate and as a result it is important for us to document our work and to be open to sharing it with our peers. Social coding platforms such as Github offer ways of documenting, sharing, and version controlling software projects such that your process of mapping data to visuals is open for use, development, and discussion. Furthermore, platforms like Github offer ways of tracking your changes to your code/process so that you can go back in time to other versions as well as serving as a project repository. 


### What we'll cover
1. The basics of versioning control and why you might use it.
2. The basic Github Environment and how you can use it for your projects


### What you'll need
+ Github installed on your computer
+ Markdown editor

### Assignment (to be started in class)
+ Set up Github
+ Create your first repository
+ Write your first readme.md 
+ Make your first commits, pulls, merges, issues, comments, etc.
